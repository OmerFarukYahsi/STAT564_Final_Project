## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)# Comprehensive data manipulation and visualization tools
library(readxl)    # Reading Excel files into R
library(curl)      # Downloading files from the internet
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
library(dplyr)     # Data manipulation toolkit
library(purrr)     # Functional programming tools
library(stringr)   # String manipulation functions
library(janitor)   # Tools for data cleaning
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)   # Data visualization using Grammar of Graphics
options(warn=-1)
```

```{r}
# Specify the web address of the Excel file
url <- "https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Documents/FHLBank-PUDB/2022_PUDB_EXPORT_123122.xlsx"

data <- "2022_PUDB_EXPORT_123122.xlsx"
```

```{r}
curl_download(url, destfile = data)
```

```{r}
raw_data <- read_excel(data)
```

```{r}
dim(raw_data)

sum(is.na(raw_data))
```

```{r}
summary(raw_data)

# Load required libraries
library(stats)

# Fit the GLM
glm_model <- glm(LTVRatioPercent ~ Bank + Borrower1Race1Type + Borrower1GenderType + 
                    Borrower1AgeAtApplicationYears + HousingExpenseRatioPercent + 
                    TotalDebtExpenseRatioPercent,
                 family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
                 data = raw_data)

# View model summary
summary(glm_model)
```

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(car)

# Residuals from the linear regression model
residuals <- residuals(model)

# 2. Independence Check
plot(residuals, xlab = "Observation Order", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Independence Check")

# 3. Homoscedasticity Check
# Plot of residuals vs. fitted values
plot(fitted(model), residuals, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Homoscedasticity Check")

# Perform statistical test for homoscedasticity
homoscedasticity_test <- ncvTest(model)
print(homoscedasticity_test)

# 4. Normality of Residuals Check
# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals", ylab = "Frequency")

# Q-Q plot of residuals
qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals)

```
